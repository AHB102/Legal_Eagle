Summary:

The Supreme Court of India allowed the appeal of an accused person and granted bail in a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case, citing the principle of "bail is the rule, and jail is the exception." The court held that the stringent provisions for the grant of bail under the PMLA cannot be used to incarcerate the accused without trial for an unreasonably long time. The court also stated that the power to grant bail lies with the Constitutional Courts, which can exercise their jurisdiction under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution to grant bail on the grounds of violation of Part III of the Constitution.

Key Points:

1. The court held that the delay in the conclusion of the trial and the higher threshold for the grant of bail cannot go together.
2. The court stated that the power to grant bail lies with the Constitutional Courts, which can exercise their jurisdiction under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution.
3. The court held that the stringent provisions for the grant of bail under the PMLA cannot be used to incarcerate the accused without trial for an unreasonably long time.
4. The court stated that the accused has been incarcerated for 15 months or more, and the trial of the scheduled offenses and the PMLA offense is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more.
5. The court granted bail to the accused on certain conditions, including furnishing bail bonds, not contacting or communicating with prosecution witnesses and victims, marking attendance, surrendering passport, regularly and punctually remaining present before the courts, and cooperating with the courts for early disposal of cases.

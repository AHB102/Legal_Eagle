The Supreme Court of India has issued a judgment (Criminal Appeal No.4011 of 2024) in the case of V. Senthil Balaji vs. The Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement. The appeal is against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Madras, which rejected the bail application of the appellant under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

Factual Background:
The appellant, V. Senthil Balaji, was the Transport Minister in the Government of Tamil Nadu from 2011 to 2016. He is accused of collecting large amounts of money by promising job opportunities to several persons in various positions in the Transport Department. Three First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against him, and he was arrested on June 14, 2023.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against the appellant on July 29, 2021, for an offense under Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which is punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA.

Submissions:
The learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the ED is relying on material collected by the investigating agencies investigating the scheduled offenses. He pointed out that the prosecution mainly relies on a file named CS AC, allegedly found in a seized pen drive, which gives details regarding the amounts received against each post.

The learned Solicitor General of India and learned counsel for the ED made separate detailed submissions. They submitted that there is no discrepancy in the description of the file name CS AC in the pen drive and the file name of the same file in the Tamil Nadu Forensic Science Laboratory (TNFSL) report.

The learned Solicitor General of India also pointed out that there is prima facie material to show the appellant's involvement in the offense punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA and the predicate offenses. He submitted that the appellant brought about an illegal settlement between bribe givers and bribe receivers.

Consideration of Submissions:
The Supreme Court has carefully considered the submissions. The main document relied upon by the ED showing incriminatory material against the appellant is a part of the pen drive seized by the State police from the appellant's premises in connection with scheduled offenses.

The Court noted that there is prima facie material to show a deposit of cash amount of Rs. 1.34 crores in the appellant's bank account. The contention of the appellant regarding the deposit of remuneration received as MLA and agricultural income cannot be accepted in the absence of any prima facie evidence.

Effect of Delay in Disposal of Cases:
The appellant has been incarcerated for more than 15 months in connection with the offense punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA. The minimum punishment for an offense punishable under Section 4 is imprisonment for three years, which may extend to seven years.

The Court noted that there are three scheduled offenses, and the trial of these offenses will be a warrant case. Even if the trials of the scheduled offenses are expedited, the process of framing charges may take a few months as many advocates representing more than 2000 accused persons will have to be heard.

Conclusion:
The Supreme Court has held that the twin conditions under clause (ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the PMLA have not been satisfied in this case. The Court has also observed that there is very strong material on record to show the appellant's involvement in the offense punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA and the predicate offenses.

The Court has directed that the appellant be enlarged on bail subject to certain conditions. The Court has also directed the trial court to expedite the trial of the scheduled offenses and to consider the appointment of a special public prosecutor.

Legal Eagle simplifies complex legal documents, transforming them into clear, accessible summaries that anyone can understand.

For even greater inclusivity, Legal Eagle offers an audio version of each summary in the userâ€™s chosen language, making legal information more accessible for everyone.

Legal Eagle leverages the power of the Cerebras-enabled Llama conversational model, integrated with a custom Langchain solution, 'Langchain ChatCerebras.' This combination ensures consistently swift summarization, making it fast enough to support real-time applications in courtroom settings
